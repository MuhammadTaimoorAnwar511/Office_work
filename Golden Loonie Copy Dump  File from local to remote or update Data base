Step 1: Connect to the Remote Server
Open your terminal and log in to the Golden Loonie server: 
ssh root@<ip>
Server password: <password>
Switch to the ubuntu user: su ubuntu
Navigate to the home directory: cd
Change into the Dumps folder (create it if it doesn't exist): 
mkdir Dumps
cd Dumps
Run the pwd command to copy the full path of the Dumps folder. This is where weâ€™ll upload the database dump file: pwd
Step 2: Transfer the Dump File from Local to Remote
Open a new terminal  on your local machine.
Copy the latest dump file from your local system to the remote server using scp: 
scp /Users/appletech/Downloads/dump-golden_loonie-202506231533.sql  root@147.93.94.61:/home/ubuntu/Dumps/
Explanation:
scp: Secure copy command
First argument: Path to the dump file on your local system
Second argument: user@remote_ip:/remote/path/ where you want to place the file
Use the same password as in Step 1 when prompted
(Optional) Run the following in server terminal to check your remote IP address: hostname -I
Step 3: Import the Dump into MySQL on the Remote Server
Go back to the remote server terminal.
Navigate to the Dumps folder and verify that the file was copied successfully: 
cd Dumps
ls
Log in to MySQL: mysql -u root -p
 MySQL credentials:
Username: root
Password: password
List available databases: SHOW DATABASES;
Choose and use the target database: USE <database_name>;
Exit MySQL and run the following command to import the dump file: 
mysql -u root -p golden_loonie < dump-golden_loonie-202506231533.sql
